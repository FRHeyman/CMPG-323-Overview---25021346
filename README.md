PROJECT INTEGRATION

BRANCHING STRATEGY
Git branching will be used for this project. 

The two branches to be used most will be a development and feature branch to track development work to be merged and new features added to the project.

These branches will allow for easy control of features and the ability to rollback development changes as a branch causes problems to the main project.
